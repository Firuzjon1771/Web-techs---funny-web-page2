            I have always had a burning desire to understand how the universe works,  what  life  is  all  about,  and  the  meaning  and  purpose  for which I am here. In retrospect, I can see that my entire life has been devoted to my search for truth and understanding.I  was  brought  up  in  a  very  intellectual,  well-educated,  non-religious family. My parents were essentially atheists, and very earlyon,  I  remember  having  the  attitude  that  a  belief  in  God  was  ahuman fabrication, a fantasy, a superstition created to help people
            feel  better  about  the  totally  unexplained,  and  unexplainable,predicament we seem to find ourselves in. Human existence, or anyother kind of  existence, was simply an accident of  nature and hadno  particularly  fathomable  meaning.  I  preferred  to  admit  that  Ididn’t know how we got here or why, rather than to adopt a sim-plistic explanation merely to gain a sense of security. I believed thattruth  was  rational  and  anything  that  couldn’t  be  proved  scientifi-cally didn’t exist. I also felt somewhat condescending toward peo-ple who were weak enough to have to make up a god to believe in.The positive side of  this upbringing was that I didn’t get a lotof  the rigid dogma and deeply negative messages about right andwrong, heaven and hell, and sin that so many people receive in theirearly religious training. On the other hand, I had no conscious con-cept or experience of the spiritual dimension of life, and no answersfor the questions I had about the meaning and purpose of my life.My parents really wanted a child, and were very loving to me.Unfortunately they were unable to work out their own relationshipand  were  divorced  when  I  was  two  years  old.  Although  I  don’tremember it clearly, I know this event had a major impact on mylife and affected my later patterns in relationship. After the divorce,I lived with my mother who never remarried or had any other chil-dren. My father did remarry, and I often visited my father and hisother family.My mother developed a successful career as a city planner in thedays when there were few women in that field. She dealt with theusual challenges of  single parenting — trying to balance the needsof her child with the demands of her work. Being the only child of a working mother, I developed a strong sense of responsibility andself-sufficiency quite early.My mother is a very adventurous person. She loves to try newthings, and for me, she was a great role model of  fearlessness andpioneer  spirit. She  had  been  one  of  the  first  educated  Americanwomen in her generation to have natural childbirth. I was the firstbaby  her  doctor  had  ever  delivered  without  an  anesthetic.  I  wasblessed with a very fortunate birth. (On September 30, 1948, at9:10 p.m. in Trenton, New Jersey, for all you astrologers!)My  mother  loves  to  explore  new  places  and  we  traveled  a  lotwhen  I  was  a  child  —  all  over  the  United  States,  to  the  WestIndies, Mexico, Hawaii, Europe. We also moved frequently when-ever my mother changed jobs. Until I was about fifteen, I had neverlived in one place longer than two or three years.My  mother’s  family  had  been  Quakers  and  we  still  used  the“plain language” when speaking to my grandmother (saying “thee”rather than “you” for the Quakers is an acknowledgement of  thegod within each person). So, on a deep level, I absorbed the pro-found  respect  for  spirit  and  concern  for  humanity  that  is  woveninto  the  fabric  of  the  Quaker  religion, which  I  feel  had  a  stronginfluence on me later in my life.When  I  was  fourteen  years  old  I  went  through  an  enormousemotional  crisis.  Triggered  initially  by  the  collapse  of  my  firstromance (with an “older” man of  nineteen — I was sure no onewould  ever  compare), it  snowballed  into  a  deep  and  long-lastingexistential despair. I took a long hard look at life and recognizedthat there was really no point or meaning to it. I could see that all the things that were supposed to provide significance in life — edu-cation,  success,  relationships,  money  —  were  in  themselvesephemeral, meaningless, and empty. There didn’t seem to be any-thing else to fill the void. I was deeply disillusioned and depressed,and basically remained in that state for several years.In retrospect, I can see that I was going through an experiencethat all of  us must pass through at one time or another (or manytimes) — what mystics call the piercing of  the veil of  illusion. It’sthe point where we begin to recognize that our physical world isnot the ultimate reality and we turn inward to discover the spiritu-al  aspect  of  our  existence. At  these  times, we  usually  feel, emo-tionally, that we are hitting bottom, but as we actually hit bottomit’s as if  we fall through a trap door into a new place — the innerrealm of  the soul, where we can begin to explore our connectionto life in a whole new way. When we can face our fears and movethrough  such  a  “dark  night  of  the  soul,”  we  are  greeted  by  thedawn of  a profound new adventure.

Not races but race. This means we agreed on the fact of our existence as a “Human” for less than 100 years.</p>
