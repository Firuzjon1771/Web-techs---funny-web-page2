                  Where do I come from?
                  The existence of our live creators in the cosmos and why it's going like that is still not proven by science. But there are millions of theories and speculations about their existence. So what to believe?
                  There is no confident answer to this question but there are some logically good theories. As you know there are over 3200 solar systems with almost the same options as ours, in only our galaxy. So you think only “We” got lucky to be on an inhabitance planet, where can be created or “magically” appeared life? No way my sincere reader.
                  There are exist other live creators. Knowledge about them is classified. Yes, it is. It sounds hard to believe but Humanity already had the opportunity to meet them or even negotiate. But to avoid massive panics and other kinds of conflicts, the governments can’t allow this kind of information to spread. We are not ready for this. As I said, humanity has come up with a common conclusion, about our “HUMAN” race being, less than 100 years. They are not ready for new races and wars. So no way to prove or find evidence about their existence.
                  And my as well. Life is simple a funny. It starts but never ends. So we do beleive.
